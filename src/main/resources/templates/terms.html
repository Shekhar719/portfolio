      <p>This site was built by me (Gaurav) to showcase my projects, skills, and a bit of personality. Since weâ€™re being honest here, letâ€™s keep the terms simple:</p>

      <h3 class="display-7 fw-bolder mb-0"><span class="text-gradient d-inline">Ownership</span></h3>
      <p>Everything on this site â€” the code, the designs, the words (yes, even the weird ones) â€” belongs to me unless otherwise credited. Please donâ€™t copy or reuse anything without asking. Inspiration is great; plagiarism, not so much.</p>

      <h3 class="display-7 fw-bolder mb-0"><span class="text-gradient d-inline">External Links</span></h3>
      <p>If I link to external sites, theyâ€™re just there for reference. I canâ€™t control what they do or show â€” click at your own discretion (and maybe donâ€™t fall for sketchy download buttons).</p>

      <h3 class="display-7 fw-bolder mb-0"><span class="text-gradient d-inline">Contact Info</span></h3>
      <p>If you use my contact form or send me an email, Iâ€™ll use that info only to reply â€” not to spam you, sell it, or sign you up for surprise newsletters. Thatâ€™s just rude.</p>

      <h3 class="display-7 fw-bolder mb-0"><span class="text-gradient d-inline">No Guarantees</span></h3>
      <p>This site runs on code Iâ€™ve written (and sometimes rewritten late at night), so I canâ€™t promise itâ€™ll be bug-free or work perfectly on every browser. If somethingâ€™s broken, itâ€™s probably already on my to-fix list.</p>

      <h3 class="display-7 fw-bolder mb-0"><span class="text-gradient d-inline">Use It Respectfully</span></h3>
      <p>Youâ€™re free to explore, read, click, scroll, and even view my code on GitHub (if linked). Just donâ€™t use anything here in a way thatâ€™s shady, illegal, or would make both of us look bad.</p>

      <h3 class="display-7 fw-bolder mb-0"><span class="text-gradient d-inline">Feedback</span></h3>
      <p>If you spot a typo, a broken link, or a way to improve something â€” Iâ€™d genuinely love to hear it. This site (like me) is a work in progress.</p>

      <h3 class="display-7 fw-bolder mb-0"><span class="text-gradient d-inline">Thanks for stopping by!</span></h3>
        Enjoy your stay, click around, and maybe reach out â€” especially if you're hiring ðŸ˜„</p>
